## Hi, I’m @**Meonako**

I've experienced with
- **C#**
- **GO**
- **Java**
- **JavaScript**
- **PHP**
- **Python**

Most of them I didn't upload on GitHub.

---

My go to language is.. ***RUST*** and ***GO***

> If it's much harder to do in **Rust** than in **GO** then I'll do it in **GO**  
> 
> For example, I have an application that query data from database and display to **stdout** as `JSON`.   
> This is super hard in `Rust` and `GO` is so easy (especially tables that have like 100 columns)

I’ll learn everything that **I'm interest** OR it look **fun**
